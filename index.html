                <h1>Hi, I'm Veronica! üôÇ</h1>
                <p>
                I am a rising senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems & Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). 
                I do research within accessible software design & development at Carnegie Mellon's 
                <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software and Societal Systems department</a>, 
                advised by <a href="https://andrewbegel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Begel</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/aaron-steinfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Steinfeld</a>. <br><br>
                
                My research focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction, and I am passionate about inclusivity 
                for minority groups, especially for women and those with neurodiversities. Focusing on accessibility, I am developing a more inclusive learning platform for individuals with cognitive disabilities
                to learn to code at their own pace. <br><br>

                I am in my third year of this research, where I am currently leading a study in which I am testing the algorithm I developed
                on potential users with ADHD in the Pittsburgh area. <br><br>
                    
                When I'm not conducting studies or writing papers, I enjoy traveling and visiting different cities
                through various HCI conferences!<br><br>
                
                I will be graduating from Carnegie Mellon with my Bachelor's degree in May 2025, and <b>I am actively seeking potential advisor(s)
                for PhD programs starting Fall 2025</b>.
                <br><br>
