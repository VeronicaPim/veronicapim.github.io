                <h1>Hi, I'm Veronica! üôÇ</h1>
                <p>
                I am an undergraduate senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems & Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). 
                I do research within accessible software design & development at Carnegie Mellon's 
                <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software and Societal Systems department</a>, 
                advised by <a href="https://andrewbegel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Begel</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/aaron-steinfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Steinfeld</a>. <br><br>
                
                My research focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and HCI, and I am passionate about inclusivity 
                for minority groups, especially for women and those with neurodiversities. I am in my third year of this research at the <a href="https://cmu-variability.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VariAbility Lab</a>
                , specifically within the usage of AI to develop tools to help neurodivergent individuals learn basic programming skills. 
                I just finished running a study where I'm testing the effectiveness of a segmentation algorithm I developed on users with ADHD to promote software engineering education for all.<br><br>
                
                I will be graduating from Carnegie Mellon with my Bachelor's degree in May 2025, and <b>I am actively seeking potential advisor(s)
                for PhD programs starting in Fall 2025</b>.
