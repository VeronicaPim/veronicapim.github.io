        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Above all, I believe in DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). I envision a future of tech where no one is left behind, regardless of their background, abilities, or identity. These core values shape my research, but more importantly, guide how I live and interact with others.
        <p>
            My ideas and values are shaped by the groups I identify with, and each of these plays a key role. These identities include:
        </p>
        <ul class="identity-list">
            <li>
                <strong class="identity-title">Being a Woman</strong>
                <p>
                    As a woman in a traditionally male dominated field, I am no stranger to environments that lack diversity and inclusion. I believe a potential solution to the lack of women in software engineering is by changing the existing pedagogical materials.

                <strong class="identity-title">Neurodivergence</strong>
                <p>
                    For as long as I can remember, I have lived with chronic migraines (as a symptom of my disability). These migraines can cause me to be bedridden for days on end, where every movement is extremely painful. I've had to develop my own learning strategies to be successful in traditional educational environments.

                <p>
                    My parents immigrated to the United States just before I was born from a small town in Russia. Growing up, I learned resilience and a strong sense of "never give up".

                <strong class="identity-title">Figure Skating</strong>
                <p>
                    I started figure skating when I was just 3 years old, and I still compete and do shows recreationally as part of the Carnegie Mellon Figure Skating Club. 
                    I am a United States Figure Skating 3x Gold Medalist, and I have been teaching beginner skaters (of all ages) since 2015.

                <strong class="identity-title">Poetry & Art</strong>
                <p>
                    I’ve always believed in the value of dreaming. I find inspiration in art, particularly poetry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite quotes is:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Since my house burned down, I now have a better view of the rising moon.” -Mizuta Masahide
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This sentiment reflects my approach to life—turning challenges into opportunities for growth and embracing the unexpected that comes with change.
                </p>
