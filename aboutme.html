        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I believe in equity and equality for all. I envision a future in technology where no one is left behind, regardless of their background, abilities, or identity. These core values shape my research and work, but more importantly, they guide how I live my life, interact with others, and approach challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            My identity is shaped by the groups I identify with, and each of these plays a key role in influencing my perspective. These identities include:

        <ul class="identity-list">
            <li>
                <strong class="identity-title">A Woman</strong>
                <p>
                    As a woman in STEM, I’ve navigated environments where I was often the only woman in the room. This has fueled my passion for making technology and education more inclusive for everyone.

            <li>
                <strong class="identity-title">Neurodivergent</strong>
                <p>
                    Being neurodivergent has shaped the way I approach challenges and problem-solving, allowing me to view the world from a unique perspective. It also inspires my research into accessibility and inclusivity.

                <strong class="identity-title">Bilingual/First-Generation American</strong>
                <p>
                    Growing up as a first-generation American with Russian roots has deeply influenced my identity. Being bilingual allows me to bridge cultural gaps and connect with diverse communities.

                <p>
                    I’ve been figure skating since childhood, and it remains one of my greatest joys. Skating teaches me discipline, creativity, and resilience, all of which carry into my personal and professional life.
